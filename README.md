## Description
---

Primitives:
---
Create a scene with all the Three.js primitives available on the same plane. Build three layers and stack them along the z-direction. A crossed pattern for the floor is implementing making use of Line Segments.

Cameras and Controls
---
Similar to exercise one, with the variation of rendering two scenes on the same page. The purpose is to experiment with two different sets of cameras and controls are used (PerspectiveCamera with FirstPersonControlsand, and OrthographicCamera with OrbitControls).

Custom geometry
---
Create a hollow cube using vertices, normals and texture mapping coordinates to set up the triangles that make up the geometry.

Robot arm
---
Build a robot arm with 3 degrees of freedom (DoF) using Three.js primitives.

Ball picking
---
Animate the robot arm built previously: place 20 balls on the floor that the robot arm will have to pick up and place in a ring. The balls can be selected by clicking on them.

VR
---
Converting the ball picking exercise into a VR experience.
